>> Software card emulation in NFC-enabled mobile phones: great advantage or security nightmare

pros and cons of mobile devices emulating NFC cards
mentions relay attacks, cites several others that demonstrate it (8, 11, 14, 15, 1, 6, 7)
software card emulation (7 (5, 13)) mostly in the context of blackberry
"it's difficult to imagine a Google Wallet and Isis wallet residing on the same phone -- especially if they are anchored to the same secure element" [2]
store sensitive information remotely, accessed via relay application

>> Practical relay attack on contactless transactions by using nfc mobile phones

followup to francis2010practical which demonstrates bluetooth nfc relay
presents a practical NFC relay of credit card transactions using only mobile phones
suggests countermeasures:
  from reader: measuring timing, distance bounding
  from card: location information, relay resistance at the communication layer (thwarted by randomization of NFC UID), application restrictions

>> Applying relay attacks to Google Wallet

evaluates feasibility of software based relay attack on google wallet
relay over TCP connection
countermeasures:
  POS timeouts (assumed in our work)
  Wallet Application pin verification (assumed in our work)
  limit capabilities of applications interfacing with RF interface
google wallet fixes this by disabling access to credit card secure element via app processor (sol. 3)

>> A Survey on Near Field Communication (NFC) Technology

Early look at where NFC technology was hoped to go:
useful for myriad of purposes from unlocking locks, payment systems, etc.
end-goal: your cell phone replaces everything you would otherwise need to use
compares NFC to bluetooth and zigbee

abstract="Near Field Communication (NFC) as a promising short range wireless communication technology facilitates mobile phone usage of billions of people throughout the world that offers diverse services ranging from payment and loyalty applications to access keys for offices and houses. Eventually NFC technology integrates all such services into one single mobile phone. NFC technology has emerged lately, and consequently not much academic source is available yet. On the contrary, due to its promising business case options, there will be an increasing amount of work to be studied in the very close future. This paper presents the concept of NFC technology in a holistic approach with different perspectives, including communication essentials with standards, ecosystem and business issues, applications, and security issues. Open research areas and further recommended studies in terms of academic and business point of view are also explored and discussed at the end of each major subject's subsection. This comprehensive survey will be a valuable guide for researchers and academicians as well as for business world interested in NFC technology.",

>> Dhwani: secure peer-to-peer acoustic NFC

Not actually NFC, but done via speaker / microphone
very interesting "self-jamming" technique to prevent eavesdropping
does not prevent any of the other attacks, of course

>> Using 3G network components to enable NFC mobile transactions and authentication

Does not consider using NFC to perform *credit card* transactions.
Explores using security mechanisms built into 3G (challenge-resp authentication) for payment authentication
Proposes payment protocol, analyzes risks
Involves mutual authentication and customer price confirmation (communicated to the phone from the POS via nfc)

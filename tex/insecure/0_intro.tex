Contactless credit card payment systems are rapidly gaining popularity.
Such systems allow customers to pay using their credit cards by simply bringing the card close to a point of sale,
    and without actually swiping or necessarily coming into direct contact with it.

This chapter describes the protocol for such payments in use at retailers today.
We refer to this protocol as the Insecure CC Protocol, because it employs hardly any protection against fraudulent use.

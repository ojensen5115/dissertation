\section{Tolerating Lack of Connectivity}
\label{unlinkable-design-3}

In this final version of the Unlinkable CC Protocol, we generate the single-use tokens within the Wallet Application.

Instead, communication between the Wallet Application and the Wallet Server is limited to Registration messages, and resolutions to synchronization problems.

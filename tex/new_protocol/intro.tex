In this chapter, we present our design for the Unlinkable CC Protocol, which achieves our three primary goals, namely
    (1) supporting unlinkabile payments,
    (2) allowing the use of any credit card,
    while (3) using existing point of sale infrastructure.

First, we base our design of the Unlinkable CC Protocol on the following two assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The retailer is not malicious
\item The Wallet Application is connected to the Internet at all times
\end{itemize}
Later, as we refine the protocol, we erode these assumptions away to yield a secure and resilient protocol.

The Unlinkable CC Protocol is designed solely for use with Electronic Wallets, and cannot be used with physical credit cards.
Thus, the first step for a customer is to download the Wallet Application and initialize a virtual credit card,
     by registering a physical card into the Wallet Application.

The card registration process is simple.
The customer launches the Wallet Application, and enters the credit card information for the card he wishes to register.
This information consists of the cardholder name, card number, expiration date, and billing address.
The Wallet Application then sends this data in a Registration message to a new principal: the Wallet Server.
This Registration message is transmitted securely over the Internet.

The customer may then use any card registered through the Wallet Application to make unlinkable transactions.

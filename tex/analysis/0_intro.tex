While using the Unlinkable Wallet Protocol has clear benefits, the naive collision mitigation strategies are inconvenient.
As such, we analyze the expected frequency of such events, to determine whether these strategies need to be improved upon.
In this chapter, we analyze the features of the Unlinkable Wallet Protocol which make it attractive,
    as well as the statistical frequency of collisions.

\section{Additional Goals}
\label{sec:goals-other}

In addition to the three primary goals of unlinkability, use of any card, and use of existing infrastructure,
    two additional goals are desirable.

\subsection{Offline Payments}
\label{sec:goals-offline}
Smart phones typically spend much of their time connected to the Internet.
Indeed, the ability to communicate with hosts on the Internet will prove useful in our protocol construction.

However, a customer may wish to perform payment transactions when a connection to the Internet is not available.
For example, a data connection may not be available in an underground parking garage.
As such, it is desirable for a payment protocol to support making payments when the Wallet Application has no access to the Internet.


\subsection{Resilience to Loss of Synchronization}

I don't think it makes sense to talk about this here.

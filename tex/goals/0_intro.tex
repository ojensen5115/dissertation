The Secure CC Protocol presented in Chapter \ref{cha:secure} is a significant improvement over the status quo (described in Chapter \ref{cha:insecure}).
However, the Secure CC Protocol neglects to provide two properties (in addition to Unlinkability) which we find desirable in a payment protocol.
We define these two additional properties:
  the ability to use existing infrastructure, and the ability to use any credit card.
With then use these three properties to guide the construction of a new protocol, which we call the Unlinkable CC Protocol.
This new protocol will maintain the benefits of the Secure CC Protocol, while simultaneously satisfying Unlinkability, the use of existing infrastructure, and the use of any credit card.

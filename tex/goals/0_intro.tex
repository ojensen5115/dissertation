The Secure CC Protocol presented in Chapter \ref{cha:secure} is a significant improvement over the status quo (described in Chapter \ref{cha:insecure}).
However, the Secure CC Protocol neglects to provide two properties (in addition to Unlinkability) which we find desirable in a payment protocol:
  the ability to use existing point of sale infrastructure, and the ability to use any credit card.
We define and justify these goals, then use these three properties to guide the construction of a new protocol, which we call the Unlinkable CC Protocol.
This new protocol will maintain the benefits of the Secure CC Protocol, while simultaneously satisfying Unlinkability,
  the use of existing point of sale infrastructure, and the use of any credit card.

The Secure CC Protocol presented in Chapter \ref{cha:secure} is a significant improvement over the status quo (described in Chapter \ref{cha:insecure}).
However, the Secure CC Protocol neglects to provide two properties (in addition to Unlinkability) which we find desirable in a payment protocol:
  the ability to use existing point of sale infrastructure, and the ability to use any credit card.
In this chapter, we define and justify these goals.
In Chapter \ref{cha:unlinkable_design} we use these three properties to guide the construction of a new protocol, which we call the Unlinkable Wallet Protocol.
This new protocol will defend against malicious outsiders an retailers, while simultaneously satisfying unlinkability,
    allowing for the use of existing point of sale infrastructure and any credit card.

The Secure CC Protocol presented in Chapter \ref{cha:secure} is a significant improvement over the status quo (described in Chapter \ref{cha:insecure}).
However, while protecting customers from fraud, the Secure CC Protocol neglects three properties that we find desirable in a payment protocol.
We will define these three properties, and use them to guide our construction of a new protocol, which we call the Unlinkable CC Protocol.
This new protocol will maintain the benefits of the Secure CC Protocol, while simultaneously satisfying these three additional properties.

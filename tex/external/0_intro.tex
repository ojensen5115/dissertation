In Chapter \ref{cha:insecure} we described the protocol in use today for contactless credit card transactions
    and showed that this protocol is vulnerable to four types of external attacks.
In this chapter, we show how to modify the protocol in order to defend against these attacks.
This modified protocol is called the Externally Secure CC Protocol.\footnote{

        acknowledgements are due to Mohamed Gouda for helping construct clear and concise protocol descriptions.

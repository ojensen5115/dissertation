The Externally Secure CC Protocol described in Chapter \ref{cha:external} focuses on defending the retailer and customer from malicious external parties, termed ``outsiders''.
In this chapter, we examine the problems posed by malicious retailers and focus on how to secure contactless credit cards against them.
As will be described shortly, attacks by malicious retailers are particularly pernicious, as they are less easily identified as fraud.
Even when these attacks are detected, the resolutions are not always simple.\footnote{

        While most of the contributions in this chapter are my own,
        acknowledgements are due to Tyler O'Meara for suggesting that the Transparent Bridge attack could be applicable to contactless credit cards,
        and to Mohamed Gouda for helping construct clear and concise protocol descriptions.

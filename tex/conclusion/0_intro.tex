The contactless credit card protocol in use today neglects even basic protections.
In Chapter \ref{cha:insecure}, we examine the protocol in detail, and show that it is vulnerable to four broad categories of outsider attacks:
  eavesdropping, skimming attacks, relay attacks, and attacks facilitated by compromised points of sale.
The current contactless credit card protocol is likewise vulnerable to attacks perpetrated by malicious retailers as discussed in Chapter \ref{cha:secure},
    providing no protection to customers from retailers wishing to take advantage of them.
In addition, the contactless credit card protocol poses significant privacy risks to customers as discussed in Chapter \ref{cha:unlinkability},
    allowing retailers to correlate purchases made using the same credit card.

In response, we design a family of three replacement contactless credit card protocols, to guard against the deficiencies in the current protocol:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the Externally Secure CC Protocol
    \item the Secure CC Protocol
    \item the Unlinkable Wallet Protocol
\end{enumerate}
The Externally Secure CC Protocol guards against the outsider attacks listed above.
The Secure CC Protocol guards against both outsiders and malicious retailers.
The Unlinkable Wallet Protocol guards against both outsiders and malicious retailers, while protecting customer privacy from curious retailers and banks.

\subsection*{overview of contributions}
The primary contribution of this work is the construction of a family of three protocols for secure contactless credit card transactions.
Each protocol use useful for different reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ESCCP for protecting from malicious outsiders and minimizing computation on the card (no hash functions)
    \item SCCP for augmenting ESCCP protection to add malicious retailers, at the expense of increased computation (hash functions)
    \item UEWP for augmenting SCCP protection to add privacy protections and use of any card, at the expense of running it on an EW application
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ESCCP and SCCP require large changes to infrastructure
    \item UEWP requires much index rebuilding on the EW server (potential performance bottleneck)
    \item Potential legal issues with regard to credit card fraud, chargeback eligibility, etc.
    \item Potential customer confusion:
        bank statements no longer as useful,
        will not work with systems that require you to e.g. swipe the credit card you used to identify yourself (ticketing systems)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{future work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Resync protocols for when iCVV and/or Account Hash gets out of sync
    \item UEWP better datastructure for EW server to minimize performance hit on rebuilding the index
    \item ...?
\end{itemize}

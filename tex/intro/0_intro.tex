Near Field Communication (NFC) is short-range wireless channel which permits two devices to communicate wirelessly,
  allowing for arbitrary computation on both devices,
  even when one lacks a power source of its own \cite{nfcspec}.
As a result, contactless integrated circuit cards (often termed ``Proximity Cards'') typically make use of the NFC channel \cite{nfciso}.

These properties also make it attractive for contactless payment protocols,
  and thus it is also the channel used in EMV's Contactless Specifications for Payment Systems \cite{emv}.
Common implementations of this specification are Mastercard's PayPass\textsuperscript{TM} \cite{paypass} and Visa's payWave\textsuperscript{TM} \cite{paywave}.

While much work that has been done attacking the contactless credit card protocol,
  there is currently a dearth of academic literature attempting to secure it.

1. Introduction
  - Why NFC
    - good for physical cards (less service, higher reliability)
    - good for Electronic Wallets (supported by phones, which are selectively enabled)
    - good for designing your own protocol
  - Related works

2. Insecure CC Protocol
  - Goals
    - payments via NFC
  - Protocol Design

3. Externally Secure CC Protocol
  - Goals
    - attacks (skimmer / eavesdropper)
    - minimize computation on card
  - Protocol Design
  - Correctness

4. Secure CC Protocol
  - Goals
    - attacks (malicious retailer)
  - Protocol Design
  - Correctness

5. Electronic Wallets in the Secure CC Protocol

6. Unlinkability

7. Additional Goalsof the Unlinkable Protocol
  - Use of any credit card
  - Use of existing infrastructure
  - Additional goals
    - support of offline payments (app offline)
    - resilience to loss of synchronization

8. Design of the Unlinkable Protocol
  - Protocol 1
    - primary goals
    - not secure against malicious retailers
    - no offline payments
  - Protocol 2
    - primary goals
    - limited offline payments
  - Final Protocol
    - all goals

9. Concluding remarks / future work
